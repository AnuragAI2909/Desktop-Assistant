This is my python project  which will automate few things of our PC. Generally,I used python libraries in this project such as Text-to-speech , calenders and few more .
Say "Play......." + song anme or any thing that you want to lay on youtube.
For Wikipedia search or if you want to know about any one just Say " Tell me about....".
You can also ask the current time by Say " Time ...".
You can also ask to prit the calender of any desired year by just Saying " Calender.....".
The one most important feature which i added in my project is ->  write notes that faculty/teacher are dictating in class just by saying " Start Writing.." . 
This whole process of writing will done in background without opening any application and will saved automatically on desired path(have to pass in line 103 of code).
If you have any work on Chrome you can open chrome without touching your system by Saying " Open chrome ".
